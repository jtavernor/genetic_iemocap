1. Better organise baseline codes
2. Save labels as labels_dim40.pkl and then make new ones with a much smaller dimension size 
3. reduce num words to like 5 
4. repeat evolution experiment 


the baseline2 takes about 15 seconds to run, while the genetic evolution one took about 18 hours

The accuracy on the test dataset is higher than the accuracy on the training dataset which is very strange and almost certainly incorrect. 

seed was not set for the prelim evolution results on iemocap
